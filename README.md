### Business problem:

Using Item Type, Fat Content, and Store Type to increase sales for Big Mart


### Data:

## Methods
- Data was first prepared using Pandas to clean the data and drop any unnecessary information for our predictions.
- We then used MatPlotLib to visualize and explore our data.
- Lastly, we used SciKitLearn to scale, encode, and model our data using various methods, some better than others.
